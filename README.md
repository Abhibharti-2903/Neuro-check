## 🔍 Overview

**Neuro-Check** is a machine learning-powered application designed to assist in the **early detection and classification of brain tumors** from MRI images. Using deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Transfer Learning, this tool classifies tumors and provides **actionable insights** such as:

- Tumor type identification  
- Recommended precautions  
- Suggested immediate treatments

All of this is wrapped in an intuitive **Streamlit interface** for healthcare professionals and patients alike.
